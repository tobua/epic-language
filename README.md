React translation library built with the Bun üê∞ runtime, Cursor AI üñ±Ô∏è editor and CodeWhisperer ü§´.

- 3 ways to store translations
  - **Bundled** Generated manually or with AI during build and stored in the bundle
  - **CDN** Generated with AI during build time and stored in a Serverless function
  - **Serverless** Translated with AI and cached during runtime in a Serverless function
- Support for React Native
- `<Text id="myTranslationKey" />` component to render translations
- Replacements with `{}` in translations
- Translations generated on demand using LLMs (AI)
- Optimized for development phase: no need to commit any translations to source!

## Usage with Buildtime Translation

This is the most basic method where all translations are bundled into the main JavaScript bundle. This is useful for development, when supporting only few languages or when distributing as a package like React Native apps. To use this method, create a main JSON file in the default language containing the initial translations. The CLI translation script can then be used to translate these keys during installation or the build.

```sh
npx epic-language --input translations/en.json --output translations --language en --languages es,zh
```

## Usage with Runtime Translation and Caching

```ts
import { create } from 'epic-language'

const { translate } = create({
  // Initial translations in default language.
  translations: {
    title: 'My Title',
    description: 'This is the description.',
    counter: 'Count: {}',
  },
  // Route to load translations for user language.
  route: '/api/translations',
  // Callback for when translations have been loaded.
  onLoad,
})

translate('title') // My Title
translate('counter', '5') // Counter: 5
```

## Usage with React Native

```tsx
import { create, Language } from 'epic-language/native'

const { translate, Text } = create(
  {
    title: 'My App',
  },
  {
    [Language.es]: { title: 'My App' },
    [Language.zh]: { title: 'My App' },
  },
  Language.en,
)

const settingsText = translate('title')
const Heading = <Text style={{ fontSize: 32 }}>title</Text>
```

ES Module exports are still an experimental feature in React Native's Metro bundler. Since this plugin requires them you have to turn them in your `metro.config.js` with:

```js
const { getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig } = require('@react-native/metro-config')

const config = {
  resolver: {
    unstable_enablePackageExports: true,
  },
}

module.exports = mergeConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), config)
```
